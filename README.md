Arduino code for Body 3D-scanner robot

During the fall of 2015 Carl Str√∂mbeck, Hugo Wakeus and Adam Jansson developed a Robot used to make a robust scan of a Human upper body

The Code presented is used on an Arduino mini to create a motion of a laser cut and 3d-printed robot arm that is used to scan a human upper body.

Current status: Differrent versions exist with various robustness and speed.
Future work: The motion could be optimized through usgin a elliptical pattern instead of the current circular, this was discovered during field tests.
